This project is an exploration of Lott and Mustard's early work on gun control using contemporary methods. PLEASE NOTE that the original project is a practical example of the problems faced by their chosen methods; both the original work and (especially) the non-representative portion that appear here should be considered with extreme scrutiny and generally read only for their econometric content. For any relevant conclusions on gun control, turn to other sources.
